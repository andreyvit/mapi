# News API

The news API endpoint:

  https://api.michigan.com/news/:source/:section

where:

* `:source` is a site identifier, which is one of the sites from [constant.js](src/lib/constant.js) without the `.com` suffix (e.g. `freep` or `detroitnews`)
* `:section` is `news`, `sports` or perhaps something else (`life`?) â€” TODO FIXME

The response is a dictionary with `articles` key, which is an array of article objects.
